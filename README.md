# Systrayezer

project in progress.

## Target

Sometimes we work with applications that don't allow "minimize to Systray". This application tries to set a global HotKey to "hide" any window and create a systray icon to restore (or pressing again the hotkey), everything configurable.

## TODO

- Save configuration file.
- Fill Datagrid with the configuration file.
- Allows autostart with windows.
- Set hotkeys on start.
- Hide a window on startup (for applications that autostart).
- Remove hotkeys.
- Apply a new created hotkey.
- Hide our systray icon.
- Get window by name (done) or by identifier (or anything else that is not bassed in the window name).
