# Systrayezer

project in progress.

## Target

Sometimes we work with applications that don't allow "minimize to Systray". This application tries to set a global HotKey to "hide" any window and create a systray icon to restore (or pressing again the hotkey), everything configurable.

## TODO

- Save configuration file.
- Fill Datagrid with the configuration file.
- Allows autostart with windows.
- Apply a new created hotkey.
- Hide our systray icon.
- Manage errors (cannot found a window with the description, maybe search it every 5 seconds?)
- Get process name by selecting a window (something like spy++), some windows have different process name in Task manager and we cannot reach it.
- Scale the app giving more options to "edit" the external window (quake style, borderless, windowed, full screen, etc).
